What is data manipulation and analysis?


1. Data Manipulation

Definition:
Data manipulation means changing, cleaning, organizing, or transforming raw data so it becomes useful and structured for analysis.

Purpose:
Raw data is often messy — it may have missing values, duplicate entries, or wrong formats. Manipulation prepares it for meaningful use.

Examples of data manipulation:

Removing or filling missing data (e.g., replacing NaN with 0 or average value)

Sorting or filtering data (e.g., only taking data from 2024)

Combining multiple datasets (merging data from two files)

Changing data types (like converting a string "25" to an integer 25)

Creating new columns from existing ones (like calculating “total_price = price × quantity”)

In Python, libraries like Pandas and NumPy are most commonly used for data manipulation.
Example:

import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")

# Clean and manipulate
df.dropna(inplace=True)                # Remove missing values
df['total'] = df['price'] * df['qty']  # Create new column
df = df[df['total'] > 1000]            # Filter rows

📊 2. Data Analysis

Definition:
Data analysis is the process of examining, interpreting, and drawing conclusions from data after it has been cleaned and manipulated.

Purpose:
To find patterns, trends, and insights that can support decision-making.

Examples of data analysis:

Calculating averages, sums, or other statistics

Visualizing trends using charts (bar, line, pie, etc.)

Finding correlations between variables

Detecting outliers or unusual patterns

Making predictions using statistical or machine learning methods

In Python, libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn are commonly used for analysis.

Example:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Visualization
plt.bar(df['product'], df['total'])
plt.title('Total Sales by Product')
plt.show()
